<div class="content"><h1>Algebra</h1>

<h2>Difficulty P</h2>

<p>Logarithms (APV) - Involves the manipulation of logarithms. There is no other topic that has consistently appeared on the AIME every year, and there are few easier topics. This is the easiest unit, but this is a must-take for all first-time students.</p>

<h2>Difficulty Q</h2>

<p>Factoring a Polynomial (AQU) - Factorizations and its close cousin polynomial division. Includes Remainder Theorem, smart factorization, and smart substitutions.</p>
  
<p>Fake Algebra (AQU) - A geometric and trigonometric perspective on algebra problems that can take a geometric form. Requires knowledge of trigonometric identities.</p>
  
<p>Sequences in the AIME (AQV) - A look into sequences in AMC and AIME competitions and a look into using recursions to characterize "How many ways can something be done with restrictions?" questions. The numbers are usually small, generalizable, and require a finishing step of some DP-Table bashing. Appears relatively often and is placed near the end of AIMEs, but is usually straightforward once the recursion has been found.</p>

<h2>Difficulty R</h2>

<p>Explicit Form of a Recursion (ART) - Finding the explicit form of a recursive relation.</p>

<p>Telescoping (ARU) - The art of cancelling. Doesn't appear terribly often on the AIME, but frequently appears on college contests. If it appears on the AIME, it will probably be a late AIME question.</p>

<h1>Combinatorics</h1>

<h2>Difficulty P</h2>

<p>Introduction to Counting (CPV) - Very basic techniques used in mid-AMC and early AIME Counting and Probability problems.</p>

<h2>Difficulty Q</h2>

<p>States (CQU) - Problems where someone does something, and you want to analyze the structure of their actions. Think "probability of flipping heads twice in a row before flipping tails thrice in a row."</p>

<p>Perspectives (CQV) - Counting problems that get solved with a clever shift in perspective. Includes stars and bars, combinatorial identities, clever bijections, and other counting techniques on the AIME.</p>
  
<h2>Difficulty R</h2>

  <p>Invariants (CRU) - Examining what doesn't change or what changes in a predictable fashion. Also includes symmetry because symmetry problems feel similar.</p>
  
<h1>Geometry</h1>

<h2>Difficulty P</h2>

  <p>Basics of Geometry (GPV) - Triangle center properties, basic angle chasing, and similar triangles.</p>
  
<h2>Difficulty Q</h2>

<p>Lengths and Areas in Triangles (GQU) - Standard geometry techniques for triangles. This is becoming less common in the AIME, but fundamentals will always stay fundamentals.</p>

<p>Slanted Coordinate Axes (GQT) - A look into using coordinate axes where the angle is not 90 degrees. Useful for parallelogram problems. There are usually two classes of problems that fall into this unit: the fairly easy problems that you know you can do but don't always see a direct way to do (or want to do), and the brutal problems turned into some relatively nice algebra. The second class of problem requires care.</p>

<p>Transformations (GQT) - Analyzing a geometric configuration by moving parts of it around. Relatively obscure, but a direct application of it has appeared on the AMC recently.</p>

<h2>Difficulty R</h2>

<p>Radical Axes (GRU) - A different look at the Power of a Point function, and what happens when the power of a point is equal with respect to two circles. On the Olympiad side, but can be useful for late AIME problems.</p>

<p>Complex Numbers in Geometry (GRV) - Geometrical uses for complex numbers.</p>
  
<h1>Number Theory</h1>

<h2>Difficulty P</h2>

<p>Modular Arithmetic (NPU) - Fermat's Little Theorem, Euler's Totient Function, Wilson's Theorem, and a lot of "Find the remainder" style problems.</p>
