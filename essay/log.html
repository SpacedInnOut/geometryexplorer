<h1>Log your Ideas</h1>

<em>First published July 19, 2020.</em>

<p>This is a followup to <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/write">What Makes Writing Good</a>. Whereas the first essay discusses how to malleate your ideas into writing, this essay discusses how to collect and store ideas for future use.</p>

<h2>Log your Ideas</h2>

<p>Every day people think of ideas, many bad and some good. Most people don't see the point in keeping track of their ideas, but doing so is transformative. There are some things worth keeping in mind when trying to find ideas worth logging, logging your ideas, and actually acting on them. [1]</p>

<h2>English Class</h2>
<p>Before I talk about keeping track of your ideas, I have to first talk about how <b>not</b> to keep track of them. Unsurprisingly, school is the embodiment of this.</p>

<p>My freshman English teacher is a great person and all, but one of the big mistakes she made was forcing us to <i>write for the sake of writing</i>. We were given contrived prompts every day and forced to sit for 6 minutes every day to write about it, while being reminded that "our pencils should be constantly moving." Already there are many things wrong with this picture - even without knowing what the prompts looked like, the result was quite predictable: a bunch of bored students killing time because they have nothing to say.</p>

<p>I don't think that it's because my classmates had no insights to share. [2] As a lower bound, the things that people text each other are worth saying, otherwise people wouldn't text each other. There's a lot of novel and interesting things yet to be said, and there's a lot of good ideas that people are thinking of. So the question is: How do you harness a well of thoughts and turn it into something <i>tangible</i>? [3]</p>

<h2>Math Competitions</h2>

<p>The best place to start with polishing ideas into writing is by starting with something tangible. Personally, math competitions is where I learned a lot of my writing lessons, and I suspect that this is the case for a substantial portion of the readership of this essay. This happens on a small scale as well - coming up with the idea that "this feels like a common external tangent so I could probably use Radical Axes here" and then writing up the solution "We claim that this line is tangent to these two circles ... Now we apply the Radical Bisection Lemma" is a translation of an idea into polished writing. [4][5]</p>

<p>For concreteness, I'll describe how my handouts get written. I first keep track of all the problems I do on a problem log, as well as any problems that I've thought about that I haven't solved yet on an unsolved problem log. [6] It's not even that organized - there's just a short description on what the difficulty ratings I assigned meant, then problems were just sorted into chronological order for each subject. Then, when I encounter a problem that could fit in a MAST unit, I add it to the corresponding problem set. [7] Finally, when I get to the point where I feel like I really understand <i>how</i> I'm going to present the material, I start drafting the theory portion of the handout, and if necessary, hunt for some problems to fill in gaps in the problem set.</p>

<p>Personally, when writing handouts or chapters of a book, there's a clear distinction between when I'm logging problems or concepts to add, versus when I actually decide to actively fill it in. The structure of my work felt surprisingly <i>discrete</i>, given that it was continuous by nature. I suspect that this can be generalized for a lot of my writings, including this essay. The idea first comes to me when I'm somewhere without interruptions, then I start dumping my thoughts onto a Notepad document, and finally I give them <i>shape</i>.</p>

<h2>Outside</h2>

<p>I've talked so much about storing and refining ideas, so I should talk about how to get ideas now. The ingredients for a good idea are exposure to other good ideas and time spent uninterrupted and alone. That's it.</p>

<p>So how do you get these ingredients? All you need to do to get exposure to good ideas is to spend time trying to solve hard problems. [8] Reading interesting ideas and finding smart friends to talk to will come naturally.</p>

<p>The best way to get uninterrupted time alone where you can let your thoughts wander is outside, and preferably you stay ouside for long durations of time. You'll find yourself discovering a lot of things worth talking about and wishing you could go and write it down. So when you get home, just log ideas in the order that they interest you. You'll be jumping around a lot while you're <a href="/essay/flood">flooding</a>, because there's no reason for the order the ideas interest you in to be linear. [9] And no matter what you do, don't bring your phone or speakers.</p>

<h2>Embarrassments</h2>
<p>One of the most common reasons people don't keep track of all their ideas is because of embarrassment. In a public sphere, this is justified - after all, some projects just seem too ambitious to attempt, and other people who've tried similar projects have <a href="/pdfs/eegV1.pdf">made a fool out of themselves</a>.</p>

<p>But "let your ideas slip away" doesn't have to be the takeaway here. There's the option of keeping your idea log private, and in fact I strongly recommend keeping the majority of your ideas there at the beginning. Making a public idea log that's a subset of your private idea log is also a good idea. [10]</p>

<p>The rule of thumb that I use is that if you're not embarrassed by what you've written privately before, you're not daring enough, and if you're embarrassed by what you've written publicly before, you should exercise more restraint and patience in publishing.</p>

<p>There's no reason that you can't keep track of ideas outside of your comfort zone. If you're worried about embarrassed, <i>keeping it private</i> [11] is always an option. [12] In fact, coming up with bad ideas in a field you aren't experienced in is the first step to coming up with good ideas in that field. [13]</p>

<p>I can't say that I regret putting the first version of <a href="pdfs/eegV1.pdf">Exploring Euclidean Geometry</a> on my website. If I did, I would've taken it down. As stupid as many of the decisions I made in the book were, writing it helped me grow a lot. I learned how to look at geometry problems through a Spiral Similarity point of view, which was necessary for problems like USEMO 2019/1 [14] and ISL 2006/G3. I learned how to write good problems, the value of typesetting in LaTeX, and the theory of Radical Axes and the Nine-Point Circle, among other things. And I've applied these lessons the <a href="/pdfs/preview.pdf">second time around</a>. Maybe in two years the preview of this book will embarrass me too. But hopefully this time around, I have the foresight to have some patience before eagerly publishing and the self-awareness to be critical of my own work. And I'm going to learn new things by rewriting this book. So even though some of the math I've written in the past embarrasses me, I don't regret doing it.</p>

<h2>Red Flags</h2>
<p>There's a distinct difference between logging and planning. Don't spend <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c915809h2173720">too much time</a> <a href="/essay/diminish">doing the latter</a>. The difference between planning and logging is that planning consists of a lot of unmalleable <i>goals</i> [15], such as "I want to make AIME," and generally involves more of a commitment and a timetable, whereas a log is a list of things potentially worth pursuing. In an log, ideas are treated as future opportunities, not commitments, and are <i>flexible</i>.</p>

<p>There is value in planning when procedural work must be done. But often plans that aren't needed get made anyway, reducing flexibility and hurting productivity. [16] Avoid unnecessary commitments, especially mental ones. <a href="/essay/whims">Trust your whims.</a> [17]</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Ideas are quite hard to come across and should be regarded as commodities. Good ideas are like water: It feels like there should be so much of it, yet people run out of it so often. And a good idea will slip through your hands unless you store it somewhere quick.<p>

<p>By logging good ideas, you can avoid writer's block. Writer's block doesn't happen because people aren't able to sit down and put their ideas to paper - it's because they've run out of ideas to put to paper. Of course you won't always be able to have a good idea to actualize. But it would be the pinnacle of stupidity not to do anything about it when keeping track of your ideas is so easy. And getting real work done over a long period of time is a slow burn - you can't get a satisfactory result without a lot of buildup.</p>

<p>You don't need to be organized or set a particularly high standard for your ideas. You just need to write it down somewhere so you can actually find it if and when you need it. Most of the things I've done [18] came from a few small thoughts and actions. So one of the best things you can do for yourself is to maximize your options by maximizing the number of promising ideas available to you, because eventually one of those ideas will pay off.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>[1] Rule zero: You cannot keep track of ideas if you don't have ideas to keep track of. You cannot act on your ideas if you don't have ideas you kept track of.</p>
<p>[2] And if this is the case, then there really <i>is</i> no point in trying to teach them how to write well.</p>
<p>[3] Expecting kids to spend time thinking about things they don't care about and cutting them short when they actually are thinking about something interesting is not the answer.</p>
<p>[4] Spoilers for HMMT February Team 2020/3.</p>
<p>[5] This is one of the many benefits of doing solution writeups <i>well</i>.</p>
<p>[6] This is actually something I only started doing in the last few weeks, and it has already paid off a lot.</p>
<p>[7] If said unit doesn't exist yet, I will make the file for that unit, do some quick document setup, and only start the problemset. There are a few units I'm not actively working on that have only three or four problems at the moment.</p>
<p>[8] And you will need to come up with good ideas to solve the hard problems, so it's a chicken and the egg scenario.</p>
<p>[9] In fact, the conclusion of this essay was the first part that was written, because I had a rough idea of some final takeaways that I knew I'd be giving. Only then did I figure out how to write the rest of the essay.</p>
<p>[10] In fact, I've publicly posted outlines of tables of contents for an Algebra II book, Revisitas (which will be retitled and reformatted), and mentioned a book on the history of logarithms.</p>
<p>[11] There's actually a better option - confide the ideas you're most uncertain of with your friends.</p>
<p>[12] If you're concerned with being embarrassed at yourself, then there are probably bigger self-confidence issues at play.</p>
<p>[13] I'll put my money where my mouth is - I'm not really experienced with writing fiction, but a story idea that has really intrigued me recently was a superhero story, where the superheroes have a fatal flaw: they weaken themselves whenever they use their superpower. When the superheroes find out about this flaw, I'd imagine that themes of sacrifice and of short-sighted selfishness would come into play.</p>
<p>[14] USEMO 2019 occurred in the summer of 2020, but has been labeled 2019 to make room for USEMO 2020, taking place during the fall of 2020.</p>
<p>[15] I'm skeptical of the value of setting goals in the first place. In particular, you shouldn't be setting goals just to set goals - if something is really worth accomplishing to you, you'll naturally regard it as a goal.</p>
<p>[16] For those of you doing math competitions: Making study plans almost always falls in the category of "unnecessary planning."</p>
<p>[17] When it comes to physical fitness, you should ignore this entirely. There you have to operate on a timetable and you absolutely have to stick to a plan, otherwise you'll eventually end up cheating yourself out of it. Other exceptions probably exist.</p>
<p>[18] Such as MAST, Everaise, and MAC (the team that wrote the JMC 10 and the Summer AMC Class). In fact the story of MAC is quite insane, and is something I'll be recounting in a future essay.</p>
