<h1>English Essays</h1>
<em>Originally published on November 19, 2020.</em>

<p>I am not the first person to suggest that <a href="https://usamo.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/writing/">English class misses the point</a>, at least when it comes to writing. But I'd go further: I think that from a philosophical and literary perspective, basing competence on English essays is actually counterproductive.</p>

<h2>Literary Analysis</h2>

<p>If you've read anything written in the last few decades, you'll notice that you don't actually need to analyze it with an air of pretension to understand what's going on. Of course, there are going to be details or clever allusions that you'd have missed without talking about the story with other people. That's what makes literary analysis so great in the first place; when you have a conversation with other people, you end up getting even more out of what you read.</p>

<p>This is why I think English essays send the wrong message. Rarely does the first or most interesting thing you wanted to talk about end up in the essay, and if it is your <a href="/essay/flooding">flooding</a> that appears in the final product, it's somehow thought of as "unpolished." The biggest harm English class does is that it tells kids that flooding is bad, and that only lazy or unprofessional people would do it.</p>

<p>For all the conversing that happens in an English class, remarkably little of it shows up in the final essays, and this is <b>by design</b>, not because people aren't paying attention to the discussions. When grades are on the line, people default to the essay that they're most familiar with - which ends up being the boring essay with a bunch of obvious observations. If you're going to get points docked for focusing on a clever self-reference that completely changes the meaning of the entire story, then why bother bringing it up to begin with?</p>

<p>So we end up missing out on the most interesting observations. But somewhere along the lines, someone decided that English class had to be more difficult. So we now have to read difficult to parse classics with little relevance to the current day. [1] Trying to overwhelm students with dozens of different tasks, from understanding the arcane language known as Middle English to formatting the quote citations, is only going to leave them feeling resentment. The reason we <i>should</i> be prioritizing the actual content of the essay is because <i>that's the hardest part to actually do well</i>. Take the following thought experiment: If I misspelled thw word "thw" every time, thw essay would be incredibly easy to fix. All I would have to do is use thw "Find and Replace" option on thw word processor I'm using, and replace "thw" with "the." And even though each instance of "thw" might annoy you, copy editors exist: these sorts of errors usually get ironed out in the publication process anyways, and it's not like typoes don't ever get fixed in a book. Dear English teachers: trust me, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Proofs-Competition-Math-Alexander-Toller-ebook/dp/B07PM962LZ">I know what I'm talking about</a>. Formatting errors should dock a grand total of 0 points. [2]</p>

<h2>Essays</h2>

<p>I think that first and foremost, literary essays should be thought of as scratch work, the same way 27 x 53 or a series of algebraic simplifications are in math class. Studying scratch work and giving organizational tips is worthwhile, but it is by no means the main focus. As someone who enjoys writing fiction himself, I believe that the "final goal" should be using the ideas you've absorbed from other fiction, nonfiction, and life, and using them to tell a compelling story. [3] Others may think differently, but what is clear is the following: nobody really believes that the essays we write in English class is anywhere close to said "final goal."</p>

<p>If essays are scratch work, then the constraints on formatting and style are equally ludicrous as Common Core addition strategies are. [4][5] This isn't to say that the MLA formatting guidelines or the Common Core scratchwork methods are the issue: it's the lack of other options that is. [6] If we want to help kids express what they're thinking, or to come away with the "aha" moment, then the last thing we should be doing is stopping them from doing what works for them.</p>

<p>Obviously common sense still applies: as much as "kyaa ohmigod ohmigod soooo cute AAAAA" is my instinctive reaction to my favorite romance scenes, it doesn't actually qualify as an intelligent or reasoned expression of my thoughts. There'll definitely be essays that are clearly not substantiative. But trying to make specific and narrowly defined guidelines for something that basically everyone can tell apart is stupid. [7] The literature we see is zany and unconventional, and that's what makes reading so amazing in the first place. So why do our impressions of them have to be so boring and methodical?</p>

<p>My biggest complaint, and the one most easily addressed, is the railing against "informality." Does anyone really think that English essays are some sort of formal paper? As far as recognition goes, English essays mean less than a post on a Tumblr blog; at least your Tumblr blog has a chance of being <i>read</i>. The reason we cannot use can't and we do not use don't is a mix of pretension and historical accidents, not because there's some actual reason. [8]</p>

<p>And what's the problem with having conversational text in the first place? An English essay has few redeeming traits to begin with. Making it hard to read through with all the "one [must/shall/etc]" and the lack of contractions doesn't help. <b>Contractions and the lack thereof can be used as light emphasis</b> - you'd pay a bit more attention to a phrase or sentence if I deliberately wrote the words out, would you not?</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>A common argument that I've seen thrown around in favor of English class is that it "teaches people how to think." [9] This vague wording is actually a bit misleading; what English class is canonically trying to teach you is how to philosophize.</p>

<p>I completely agree that literature is a great way to prompt the development of philosophy. And since <a href="/essay/log">good ideas are scarce</a>, I believe that intentionally confining yourself to a set of genres <i>and being proud of it</i> is kind of silly. [10] But I don't think that a philosophical piece should necessarily relate to be confined to a work of literature anyways.</p>

<p>School often likes to pretend that the things it forces you to do are somehow "relevant to the real world." But for English class, you could actually make a case for this; <b>philosophizing is accepting the melancholy of the world</b> and moving forwards anyways. This is a helpful skill to have, especially given recent times. And fiction is (correctly) described as either an escape, or a way to actually become attached to a series of thought experiments. But as with all universalizable fields, we should at least not be actively <i>discouraging</i> philosophy essays (a more general application), if not actively encouraging them.</p>

<p>Right now, the system is spewing bullshit about a classic nobody cares about, forgetting about it entirely, and repeating. We're not teaching kids how philosophize - we're just teaching them how to hate reading, how to hate writing, and how to hate thinking.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>[1] I have an irrational bias <i>towards</i> the classics, and I think that using them for educational purposes is unproductive. Imagine how someone who just reads for enjoyment and doesn't want to spend half their time deciphering the story would feel.</p>

<p>[2] I do not think the same thing holds for "grammar," but I also think that's a silly way to think of word choice and flow anyways. I'll just use Clarkesworld's words here: "Language is important. There is no distinction between style and substance."</p>

<p>[3] Here's a <a href="https://guya.moe/read/manga/Kaguya-Wants-To-Be-Confessed-To/56/13/">brilliant example</a> of this (p. 13-16).</p>

<p>[4] If you believe that essays are actually a final product, let me ask you this: When's the last time you read an English essay for fun?</p>

<p>[5] If high school English essays are somehow supposed to be a final product, then that's all the more reason to free up these constraints. Nobody wants to watch a bunch of samey reality TV dating shows, and those are manufactured to be digestible. So who's going to be interested in a bunch of samey, substanceless, and pretentious English essays?</p>

<p>[6] Even though I didn't say it then, I will now: Common Core and MLA formatting guidelines are atrocious, and the education situation would be a lot better if something more sensible were mandated. But that only treats some of the symptoms and doesn't address the problem.</p>

<p>[7] The sensical broad guideline for whether an English essay is good or not is whether it's actually <i>meaningful</i>. If it was possible to get any more specific than that, then we'd be able to mass-produce English essays and I'd be saved a lot of sleepness nights.</p>

<p>[8] The claim that "this is just so you're ready for the <i>real deal</i>" (which, of course, is ignoring the fact that most people are not going to grow up to become professional snobs) is also hard to justify, since <i>good ideas should take precedence over formatting</i>.</p>

<p>[9] If you've ever talked about math education, this refrain should sound <i>very</i> familiar.</p>

<p>[10] On this note, I'm incredibly disappointed that English classes only study old European works. There's only two reasons you could justify this: you're either prejudiced enough to believe that a eurocentric view of literature is superior, or you don't care enough to fix this.</p>
