<h1>Calculus (CPM)</h1>

<p>Over the generations, scam artists have been evolving their tricks. Though many scams openly flaunted the law in years past, from Charles Ponzi's pyramid scheme to Victor Lustig, a man who "sold" the Eiffel Tower and scammed Al Capone, such fraudulent machinations are much easier to perform when the government allows, nay, enforces people to fall victim to the scam. In recent years the American textbook industry has shown the world that one of the most lucrative and safest victims of a scam are the US Government, who will readily and blindly give up tax dollars in the name of education. Enter the new con artist of the generation: CPM. The problems are asinine, the book is unsuitable for self study (not that it was suitable for group study or class study either), the authors don't seem to know the first thing about organization, and the flavortext makes you want to punch a wall.</p>

<p>In fact this is a staple of the CPM series: The same soulless, boring, shallow, and almost condescending style can be found in all of their books. If you're being forced to use this, I am so, so sorry for the amount of suffering you're about to go through. (Especially if you're the teacher - kids are going to blame you for this book even though you weren't involved in this.)</p>

<p>The complete joke that is the rest of their organization cannot be understated. They claim to support "research" in the field of "mathematics education" (there's no way that this doesn't raise a bunch of red flags and questions - Why not just get good at teaching? Who gave you the right to decide what constitutes a good teacher? A good student?). And of course, their "research briefs" consist of one measly PDF that tells us that teaching helps you learn, and that you have to actually solve problems to learn. And this is somehow supposed to "support CPM's educational principles," while screaming "typed up on MS Word by an intern who couldn't install LaTeX." There's no way an organization that looks like this could make a good textbook. Their "research," by the way, can be found <a href="https://pdfs.cpm.org/statistics/sallee_research.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am torn between whether I should call CPM a bunch of morons or geniuses. It takes much less effort to actually write a good math textbook at this level (take it from me, someone who has actually <i>done this</i>), but at the same time you cannot deny that short of just the College Board, CPM has pulled off one of the most flawless cons, ensnaring million of students in their devious and clever trap. But a con must necessarily have a victim, and when the victim concerns the educations of millions of American high schoolers, I am forced to condemn rather than congratulate these con artists.</p>
