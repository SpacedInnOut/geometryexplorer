<h1>American Born Chinese</h1>
<p>This was supposed to be a humorous graphic novel about the struggles of an ABC by an ABC author, and I had high hopes for this. Instead we get a caricature of a native Chinese, a rehash of Journey To The West except with a western notion of god, because our own traditions are just too unrefined and must be westernized or something, and a portrayal of white people as racists who can't accept people of any other culture. I generally do not care much if authors violate some social justice principle, even if there is legitimate ground for concern there. But it is somewhat disconcerting to see other people here state that it somehow advances the position of the Asian-American, rather than reinforcing the negative stereotypes it purports to fight.</p>

<p>The real reason I dislike this book is because of its lousy plot, poor characterization, and an unexplained twist ending that destroys the message that the book was trying so hard to build: that even amidst an unfamiliar and foreign world that doesn't welcome you, your actions will have consequences, and they will cause conflicts that you must man up and resolve on your own. No magical deity will come slap your senses back into you; hopes for a better future, if unaccompanied by action, are only wish fulfillment at best. And the factors that cause the main character to be unable to change should be, first and foremost, consequences of his personality and his lack of internal growth, not the convenient fact that his racist stereotype of a "cousin" prevents him from making progress.</p>

<p>Fantasy and mysticism are elements that can be blended with the initial helplessness of being in a foreign land whose rules and culture you do not understand; after all, what land is there more strange, more terrifying, and yet more beautiful than a culturally rich and diverse country? But the fantasy must serve to emphasize the human, for it is how the characters adapt to an unfamiliar world that really matters in works like these; a rich setting can only complement the story if the characters are human in the first place, and if the characters have to deal with the consequences of their actions. Yet the other characters and the machinations of this world seem to ignore crucial actions that a character takes, actions that fundamentally change the way they are characterized. This serves to make an incoherent narrative.</p>

<p>The ending serves to undercut any impactful message from the graphic novel; now that the main character's friend is secretly a monkey, it only serves to emphasize that cultural differences cannot be overcome, which goes against the whole point this book was trying to make. Speaking of the monkey part, that seems to be the only compelling part of this triad of tales, and it's the one part that this author did not invent. If you're looking to experience Chinese culture and also read an influential classic instead of a modern tale plagued by harmful norms of "social justice," I recommend reading Journey From the West instead. In fact, any of the four Classic Chinese Novels probably offer a much more genuine experience of the culture.</p>
