<h1>Legend</h1>

<p>
This book does not trust the reader's intelligence. The major twist of the story is made immediately obvious, and excessively so; the knife wound being in the chest after Day sees it go in the shoulder, for one, should be an immediate giveaway; and even if this detail was not picked up on, the characterization should have been enough. In fact, the characterization and the mood did succeed in implying that Day was not the killer, and it felt like a waste for the author to just spoon-feed this to the reader. And the penchant being the reason that June finds out Day's identity is frankly ridiculous, because a) how many people in the world have a pendant, b) I don't care how much of a "genius" you are, because there's no way you just randomly spot the pendant and make that connection, and most importantly c) it feels like a cop-out, like the author couldn't figure out how to solve the problem she created in the first place.</p>

<p>The romance is shallow and purposeless, and it adds nothing to the plot. It does not tell us anything about Day or June, and it does not serve to develop the plot. It just tells us how unbelievably attractive they both are, as if we needed any more reason to believe that they were Mary Sues. What instead could have been an intelligent, nuanced ideological conflict is reduced to "I really don't want to hate him/her, he/she is just too hot." I strongly feel that adding romance to a book not primarily focused on it should only be done if it fulfills a unique purpose that no other tool in the writer's toolkit could. This book's romance fails the litmus test so hard that not only does the romance not add any value to the story, it detracts from the potential that the book had.</p>

<p>Speaking of nuance, dystopian worlds are best if there is some form of nuance. A chilling dystopia is cruel - but it is not cruel without purpose. While there is a canonical purpose to the diseases, it felt too obvious to be a satisfying twist and falls apart under several seconds of scrutiny. There's a reason no dystopian government in our history or in the classic dystopias have used disease as a form of internal population control; because you can't control it. Some may argue that the Americans spreading smallpox to Native Americans with blankets is a counterexample; firstly, that isn't true, the one attempt ending up failing, and secondly, even if something of this kind were to hypothetically happen, it's premised on something completely different from the book's circumstances. And the government's callous disregard for life makes the argument completely one-sided in favor of the protagonists.</p>

<p>In a dystopia, we must either have some compelling reason to believe that the current world has some benefit, but ultimately the cost isn't worth it, like Brave New World's regimented class divisions preventing conflict, soma causing temporary happiness, and so on, or we must be compelled by the way the characters respond and rebel against the system, such as Winston and Julia's resistance against the government in 1984 devolving into a frantic and shallow hunger for sex, or Guy Montag's discontent with his shell of a wife. But this world has no positive elements, and the characters do not change in an interesting or nuanced way. It's a fun book to read, but ultimately the value is somewhat minimal. If you can't figure out what else you want to read and this book is sitting on your to-read shelf, I think this book is fine, but if you have something else on your to-read I'd recommend reading that first.</p>
