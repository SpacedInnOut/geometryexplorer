\section*{Introduction}
This is a preview of Exploring Euclidean Geometry V2. It contains the first five chapters, which constitute the entirety of the first part.

This should be a good introduction for those training for computational geometry questions. This book may be somewhat rough on beginners, so I do recommend using some slower-paced books as a supplement, but I believe the explanations should be concise and clear enough to understand. In particular, a lot of other texts have unnecessarily long proofs for basic theorems, while this book will try to prove it as clearly and succintly as possible.

There aren't a ton of worked examples in this section, but the check-ins should suffice since they're just direct applications of the material.
