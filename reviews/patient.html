<h1>The Silent Patient</h1>
<p>Let's start with an anecdote. I told one of my friends the premise of the story; a woman kills her husband and refuses to talk about it, and some psychotherapist obsessed with her for some reason tries to find out the reasoning behind the murder. Also, he figures out his wife is cheating on him. My friend immediately interrupts me to say, "Wait, wait. Let me guess. The wife was cheating with the dead husband."</p>

<p>I also told him, after he guessed the identity of the cheater, that some random man began following her. Obviously he knew who it was.</p>

<p>This book is one of the most disappointing books I think I've read this year. It highlights how important planning out your story is, and actually reading the story to make sure it makes sense. Did you load Chekov's gun? Then you fire Chekov's gun. It is okay to have characters that affect other characters but don't end up delivering a major impact to the plot. It is okay to have a side story to serve as a foil to the main plot, even if it doesn't interact with something. It is not okay, however, to have Theo pointlessly "investigate" people so we can all pretend that Theo is not the killer/stalker. And Theo pretends to the reader that he believes that he isn't the stalker or whatever, but his motives were always clear to himself from the start so it's frankly unconvincing that he was just lying to himself. I guess I just want plots to amaze rather than crumble under scrutiny or something; silly me.</p>

<p>And worst of all, Alicia starts talking because she meets Theo. And she never decides to implicate him before and only decides to implicate him after being drugged, despite his culpability in the murder. For some reason she decides to give Theo her diary too? There's no way, knowing what I know now, that any of this makes sense.</p>

<p>I do have to give the author some credit, though; never did he imply that him finding out his wife was cheating happened in the same time frame as his psychotherapy. But Theo was boring and I frankly couldn't really care what happened to him, and any interest Alicia generated was based on plotholes and stupidity that ended up annoying me afterwards.</p>

<p>God damn it. The author tried so hard to obscure the "twist" and ended up making the book make no sense and have half of the pages be pointless. I did not find him exposing Jean-Felix or Max as creeps (or the fact that everyone seemed to be an asshole) compelling, and I kept reading because I wanted to be proven wrong. I was vaguely aware that the premise did not leave a lot of room for making a good ending, but I was determined to read and see just how clever the twist was. Halfway through I knew the ending was going to be stupid, I just wanted to see how it ended. Now I'm really disappointed, because the only "logical" ending ("we can't introduce a new character, so the cause must be one of the old characters, but only Theo matters because the other assholes are too assholey to be anything but a red herring") was so stupid. I wanted to at least see a creative or spectacular sea of flames at the end, not just the most boring option.</p>

<p>An interesting story doesn't need a stupid twist to be good. It needs compelling characters, an intriguing world and plot, and a reason to believe that the characters and plot will develop and interact with each other in an interesting way. An interesting "cheap summary" (like painter kills her husband and refuses to speak!) is fine, but only if asking "so what really happened?" brought out an amazing world or moving characters. "Oh, I guess the twist was a little unexpected" does not cut it.</p>
