<h1 style="color:#557efa;">Summer AMC Class</h1>

<p>The Summer AMC Team, consisting of Dennis Chen (dchenmathcounts), Alex Zheng (molocyxu), William Dai (innumerateguy), Ethan Han (youyanli), Depsilon0, mathgirl199, skyscraper, and Radio2 would like to present their 2020 AMC class, run under the Youth Euclid Association.
<br><br>  
Our team consists of a qualifier for the 2020 USAJMO, two three-time AIME qualifiers, and everyone in the team has qualified for the AIME.</p>

Depsilon0 has also taken a significant number of advanced math courses, including multivariable calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and (most recently) real/complex analysis. Outside of math, he also enjoys physics, chemistry, and swimming.</p>

<h2>mathgirl199</h2>

<p>mathgirl199 is a rising 8th grader. She took the AMC 10 this year, qualifying for AIME and making the Achievement Roll and she received a score of 9 on this year's AIME II (AOIME). In her free time she likes to read.</p>

<h2>Radio2</h2>

<p>Radio2 is a USAMTS Perfect Scorer and a rising freshman at the University of Oxford. He enjoys sudoku, Minesweeper, and Latin in his free time, and his ambition is to document all future Reaper games.</p>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>We will be running a 4-week program with two lessons a week, handouts to read beforehand for each lesson, and problem sets to submit as homework after each lesson. This will be an intensive course, so we do not recommend students already significantly busy in the summer to sign up for this program as well.
<br><br>
Each lesson will be 75 minutes. A large portion of the learning will be self-guided and depend on each student’s effort on handouts and problem sets. Our philosophy is to create a program that will continue to be useful even after the class is over, so the class will be designed to promote good study habits and self-sufficiency, encourage students to ask for help when they need it, and show the scope of math competitions. To this end, we provide lists of further reading to peruse in each handout. In addition, solutions to problems on problem sets will be submitted to teachers and graded with some comments.
<br><br>
Here is an overview of the lessons. The fifth lesson will be the hardest, so we will request that students do special things to prepare for it a week before.</p>

<h2>Timetable</h2>
<p>Classes will be on Mondays and Thursdays, from 1:45-3:00 PM PDT. The class will begin on July 6th.
<br><br>
Here are the local times for all USA timezones. Arizona does not observe daylight savings, so the class will be at 1:45-3:00 PM in their timezone. International students should consult a timezone converter to see when the class is in their local time.</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>Classes for “Pedagogy” and “Mistakes” will be open to the public, with the former occurring before the first lesson and the latter after the last lesson. We will also be hosting a mock AMC 10 written by the team as a final exam, which will also be posted in the <a href=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864_aops_mock_contests>Mock Contests</a> forum.
<br><br>
Pedagogy is scheduled for June 28th, from 1:45-3:00 PM in PDT. (Refer to the timetable to see what time that is in your timezone.) Pedagogy will discuss learning how to learn, some takeaways from math competitions, resource recommendations, and will also have a few problems. This is a lecture for the general public, so parents are encouraged to attend as well. The problems will be on the easy side for accessibility.
<br><br>
Mistakes will be about minimizing silly mistakes (“sillies”) in math competitions. We will present some questions where it's easy to make a mistake, go over how to reduce making these mistakes, and talk about the best way to deal with making silly mistakes after a contest.</p>

<h3>Pedagogy Details</h3>
<p>We will be sending out the zoom information on google classroom. If you're interested, please join the Google Classroom with the code <b>xj7gpqc</b>, where we will announce the zoom meeting information. Signups are not binding. We will also be releasing further samples and will answer questions asked there.</p>

<h2>More Details</h2>

<br>
<br>
Certain internal details, such as how grading works and how communication will work, will be revealed to students and parents who signed up in due time.
</p>
