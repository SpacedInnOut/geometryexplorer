<h1>Promised Neverland</h1>

<p>Here is a multiple choice exam.</p>

<p>How do you humanize a villain? <br>
A) Boring flashbacks and making them do a heel-face turn from psychotic to supportive for no reason <br>
B) Showing their motivations before episode 12 through consistent and relatable actions</p>

<p>How do you impress and dazzle the audience with your plan? <br>
A) Boring flashbacks that always, and I mean always, pan out conveniently <br>
B) Showing their planning and the machinations of their mind
</p>

<p>How do you pull off a twist? <br>
A) Make all the cards line up against someone or something with no regard for your twist making sense, and explaining it through boring flashbacks and character asspulls <br>
B) Leaving clues for the twist, making sure that at the end each character's actions line up with themselves (it does not have to line up with the viewer's initial impression of the characters!)</p>

<p>If you picked A for all three questions, then congratulations! You are the anime Promised Neverland. Now if you got these questions all wrong, don't worry, there's a bonus question.</p>

<p>How do you disappoint your audience (and I mean really disappoint them, make them upset at what your show is)? <br>
A) Squander a good premise with silly characterization and absurd twists, making your viewer pull their hair out screaming "Why?!"<br>
B) Just make it bad in the beginning because nobody will care enough to watch an obviously bad/joke show.</p>

<p>Well, 1/3 points is better than 0/3, so congratulations!</p>
