<h1>You Have the Right to Remain Innocent</h1>

<p>Inspired by his famous talk at the Regent Law University, "Don't Talk to the Police," Duane's "You Have the Right to Remain Innocent" is an expansion the details some of the more frivolous uses of the law by prosecutors, and the unrelenting manner in which police and prosectuors will punish for mistakes you cannot reasonably be expected not to make. Given the events that happened in the latter half of 2020, this is a book that is especially pertinent today. Even though I am about to expound on some of the problems I had with this little book, please do not let this deter you from getting the book and reading the whole thing.</p>

<p>Duane's possible personal connections with some police officers, though, does end up clouding the messaging a little - certainly there are good cops and bad cops, but it is odd to condemn the congressmen and judges for their actions, but not intentional misconduct by the police. He starts by saying that police lie to citizens while making sure their children never fall trap to this, but then does the opposite of condemning the police who choose to execute such flawed policies that the courts and Congress allow.</p>

<p>The stories are anecdotes intended to warn, but I think he loses out a bit on the possible value by not going in the nitty gritty of any of the cases, instead using the bare minimum to rehash a set of similar points. The second and third parts, the third part especially, read like they were unpolished afterthoughts.</p>
