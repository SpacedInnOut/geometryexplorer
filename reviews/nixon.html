<h1>All the President's Men</h1>

<p>The story of Richard M. Nixon, how far some of his cronies would go to help him for their partisan interests, and how several brave Americans had the courage to do the right thing in a time where many good men would stay silent and complicit out of fear, is one that is inherently worth understanding, particularly during current times. Bernstein and Woodward's gripping reconstruction of their initial investigative journalism and how it led to the ultimate downfall of Nixon is a must-read, and it does not hurt that this is a very easy read.</p>
