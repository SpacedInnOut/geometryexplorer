<h1>Supernova</h1>
<p>Renegades was one of my favorite books. It took the classic "good vs evil" superhero story and completely flipped it on its head and instead shows us a spitting image of reality: just a bunch of people fighting to protect the people they love. The first book was so good that I immediately bought the second one on release. The finale, however, did not live up to expectations.</p>

<p>This book takes a lot of what made the first book so good and tosses it away; the conflict between the Renegades, the Anarchists, and the Rejects that made the book so worthwhile and interesting to begin with was resolved by a "hey everyone, let's just be friends" moment, which felt like a major asspull. The resolution of Nova's conflict between her love and friendship and her duty felt incredibly cheap, with the fact that Ace Anarchy was behind the death of Nova's family feeling like an awful copout to give Nova a reason to actually choose to neutralize Ace Anarchy in the end. Adrian, one of my favorite characters in the series, is reduced to a pathetic, generic idiot midway through the story. Honey's penchant for cruelty didn't feel entirely uncalled for, but it was definitely exaggerated in comparison to the last two books.</p>

<p>So what the hell happened here? Why is it that such a promising premise - one which very well could've concluded in the space of one book, and one which I indeed expected to conclude - ended so disastrously? And why is it that this book had bits and pieces of good philosophy, moral dilemmas, and shocking revelations, but they were all so disjoint? I suspect that this trilogy, much like nearly every modern trilogy, ends so terribly because the ending was not thought out at all before writing began. One could hazard that it wasn't even until the first book was nearly finished that the idea of a trilogy was floated; after all, if the author could think of a satisfying way to end the series, we likely would have gotten two superb books instead of the terrible conclusion we ended up with.</p>

<p>Indeed, recent trilogies near universally have disappointing endings, because in the modern era length is a symptom of an insecurity of ideas rather than an abundance of them. And perhaps I should have seen this coming; after all, in the first and particularly the second book, the intensity of the characters' emotions and ideals did not match the intensity of the stakes at hand. Regardless for the reason behind this disappointing and anti-climactic ending, it remains that the author could not close out an amazing premise in a logical or satisfactory way.</p>
