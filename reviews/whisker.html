<h1>A Whisker Away</h1>
<em>This is a review typed up immediately after a groupwatch.</em>

<p>This movie can basically be split into two parts. The most problematic part of this movie is that neither part seems to be from the same movie. Is this a slapstick comedy? A coming of age story? A romance? There are some works which really utilize all of the things it has well, but this film feels like it just slapped some common elements together.</p>

<p>I really didn't like this movie much. The premise was okay, in that transforming into an animal is a premise that's been done before. I was hoping for a refreshing take, especially because I've heard a lot of good stuff about this movie from initial reviews. Transforming into an animal to get closer to your crush who hates your human personality actually had a lot of potential, if they made the takeaway not to be pushy or whatever. But instead, with the second act of this movie, we get a sudden romance even though there's no hint of this developing before. It's just "actually I love you because we couldn't find a way to end the movie."</p>

<p>Chekhov's gun is meant to be fired. But the writers don't seem to have taken this to heart, and it feels like they just set up some stuff to feel clever only to never actually follow up on it. What about the stepmother? Just a way to create artificial conflict in the beginning. What about the pottery? Just to make a character feel sad. It's okay to have a character driven story with the plot being used as a tool, but you can't just go and completely disregard the sense it makes. In fact, I think that's why the two parts of the movie fit together so poorly.</p>

<p>The fantasy elements of this movie really had potential. The world was drawn so well, and it really gave a "cat-like" feel to the story. But the rules were unclear and many events just felt like asspulls. Originally she was just supposed to turn into a cat, no going back. Then she actually can turn back into a human. Then she can't turn back into a human because she secretly hates life, I suppose. And then the cat has to take them to a place, and there's apparently no getting out of it, but the other cats just came in for a deus ex machina. There's really no suspense or tension because we basically know the movie's going to somehow make the protagonists win, because we've already seen it doesn't respect the plot at all. Of course, magic is interesting because it is unpredictable to the characters and because it goes awry, but magic should never trump consistency or logic.</p>

<p>The characters were, to put it mildly, not very enjoyable. The girl was one of the most cringy and annoying characters, especially in the first half of the film. I could not root for someone who effectively stalked their crush and did the stupid stuff that she did. When they set her fall up, I found myself really indifferent to the sadder moments she went through, such as her confession or her face being stolen; none of it believable or relatable. The love interest also made himself very dislikeable when he rejected the girl in a completely unbefitting manner, and I really couldn't stomach the subsequent romance after the movie just ignored that. The mother was also just an ass to be an ass, and the other cat was probably supposed to make me feel sad for someone but I couldn't figure out why he even existed in this film other than to serve as a plot machine.</p>

<p>The art and music were nice. I enjoyed the style, though some of the music wasn't exactly the type I liked. But that's just my personal taste and not really reflective of the quality of it. One of the people I watched this film with said that the voice acting was awful. I didn't find it atrocious, but it was not wonderful. There was an instance where someone said something in the calmest tone, and then his character just randomly starts crying, which really hurt the suspension of disbelief that they film relied so heavily on.</p>
