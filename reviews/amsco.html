<h1>AP World (AMSCO)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, back when students were but wee children, history was presented in a dull, mind-numbingly boring fashion because our little brains could not handle any sort of nuanced, deep exploration of what was happening. And of course we were so undisciplined that we needed games to make us interested in this inherently interesting and amazing subject. But now we're in high school! Some of us can drive cars, for crying out loud! We're young adults (whatever that means) and we can now learn about the nuances of history and examine the traditions of Asia, the philosophy of Buddhism, or the wide-reaching consequences of the Protestant movement that carry forward to this day. And the College Board understands this, so I am infinitely grateful to their kindness for allowing us to use our brains more. No longer is history a list of events that happened - no, no, we've outgrown that in the fifth grade - it is now a vague list of events with a very artificial and formulaic list of causes and consequences!</p>

<p>And this book, adhering to the College Board's principles of simplified history, of condensing the tales of people into short blurbs on (GOV) Governence: How states developed over time (descriptive, I know), manages to completely suck the life out of history. It's books like these that make me wonder how math is the universally hated subject in school instead of history; sure, in math class, you're often forced to memorize garbage that you don't care about, but at least you can occasionally use these tricks that have been bashed into your head to do something marginally cool, and at least the answers make sense: A mathematician will definitely not agree that whatever schools do in math is worth answering, but at least said worthless answer is definitively, unarguably, unambiguously correct. (Yes, there's some nuance: what you learn in calculus class is often not only pedagogically wrong but also mathematically wrong, but I digress.) In history class you have a list of useless things, and the only semblance of a logical structure they hold is in the implicit rules of the mind-numbingly boring, deliberately tricky MCQ/SAQ/LAQ/whatever other garbage the College Board throws at students.</p>

<p>This book and the College Board's AP exam takes all of the problems that people have with competition math and magnifies them to absurd proportions. The AP exam is just a collection of bland tricks with no resemblance to what historians do and no use in life. As one infamous student "in" the competition math circle complains, "Memorization is not what math competitions are about, and I have seen that memorization is especially prominent in big competition math areas. There are lots of people who memorize." (Note: The original last sentence was "There are lots of people who do not memorize." From the context of the quote, and the way this student behaves, I am nearly certain that what I wrote was the intended meaning.) Even though the quote is absolutely senseless in its original context, it wholly applies to history - a few tricks that are somewhat hard to characterize but certainly present is all that is behind the harder MC questions in tests and quizzes, a few tricks are all that is necessary to get a good score on the SAQ, et cetera. We have gone backwards from memorizing facts about history; at least before it was memorizing things that happened, but now we are being forced to discern and memorize what the College Board and their cronies are looking for. It is a tragedy that the education mafia has allowed history class to look like this.</p>

<p>Isn't the point of history transcending shallow labels or generic opinions and making a logical and revealing analysis about how the past connects to the present? Why, then, must we take a test that by design is about regurgitating "the list" of causes and effects, just as we regurgitated "the list" of events in grade school, and why should the primary objective of a history textbook be about preparing for this test, which is at best orthogonal to learning history? To teach history it is necessary to engender a feeling of awe, a reflective mindset, and a spirit of discovery; the only awe to be had here is how it is possible to write a textbook as bad as this. And by being a failed history textbook it fails to be any good at preparing students for the inane exams they must take; no matter how condensed or perfect your "catch-all" to the AP Exam is (which it is not, since uninteresting lists tend not to be memorable), the value of a book is mostly contained in what is actually read. Good luck convincing someone to read this.</p>

<p>There are no factual inaccuracies, but the facts and commentary in the book are about as deep as a kiddie pool. You could take one of the chapters, word for word, and convince me that a high school student was forced to do this as a class project. And the worst thing about this book is that it is about as compelling as what an amateur could produce, but it has none of the zealousness and earnestness that a passionate amateur's debut would have. I would rather that this textbook take Campbell's approach; even though Campbell says more than is necessary for success on the AP exam, he is at least communicating information in a more meaningful manner. This book says so little that it's no wonder that students use Wikipedia or Crash Course instead to review - at least those resources can hold my interest.</p>

<p>In fact the leading coefficient that makes this book so inane and such a far cry from the telling, examining, and connecting of stories past to stories present is the College Board. I think the non-fiction I write is presented clearly and interestingly, but if I had to prepare kids for AP exams, there is no chance that I would do better. But the difference between a bad historian and a good one is that the bad one will let himself be tainted by the College Board, and the good one will continue telling the stories of people, so this book and its author has earned the condemnation that I am giving it.</p>
