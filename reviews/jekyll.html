<h1>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h1>
<p>Horror, at its core, is a genre that seeks to psychologically chill by subverting expectations. It is not the surreal nature that is so revealing of our nature; it is how otherwise ordinary people are affected and react to it. Stevenson's story, then, is so horrifying because it speaks to the universal corrupter of good men and the downfall of reputations and legacies; it proclaims that the power to ignore consequences does not exist, and the illusion of said power ruins people.</p>

<p>Hyde does not embody the evil of meticulous planning nor the evil of ideology. It is instead the evil of carelessness, of capriciousness, almost like how an addict or alcoholic engages in self destructive tendencies despite wishing to be rid of them. Hyde is the declaration of man that he is somehow special, that he has the moral strength to resist such change, or that there is some compelling reason that he and he alone should have the power, the right to be evil. And it is Jekyll who falls prey to the misunderstanding that good men are strong, or that there is something special they and they alone know that keeps them moral; it is Jekyll who does not understand that men are a product of their circumstances, and that good men are careful to control the situations that they allow themselves to be found in.</p>

<p>Stevenson's story, then, is not horrifying because of what happened to the characters; it is horrifying because any of us could become Jekyll, so grossly deluded and self-important to think that we may avoid the consequences of our actions, while at the same time profusely swearing that we are paragons of morality and would never stoop to such depths.</p>
