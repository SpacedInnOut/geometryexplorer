<h1>Linear Algebra (Norman)</h1>

<p>Forgettable, old, Pearson. The examples are all number spam/computational and forgettable, the problems are all annoying and boring rather than informative, and the pedagogy is presented in a fashion of "okay here's all you need to know to bluff your way through the test, stuff just happens so now go bash." Also the design is very stupid: in the first chapter, spans and linear (in)dependence is introduced. The definition of a basis is a natural and important result, but instead of making it pop it it just hides with the examples. If I didn't know what a basis was I would've been really confused when I saw the "first" mention of a basis in a random example/exercise/line in the text.</p>

<p>I would suggest just reading something else; Linear Algebra Done Right is very popular. If you have to use this book, take comfort in the fact that at least there technically isn't stuff missing, even though this book presents a matrix as an array of numbers. (And if you don't see what's wrong with that, I would suggest taking the time to learn linear algebra properly; it's a very interesting topic if taught right.) Even if you're not trying to major in math, you should still get a better understanding of linear algebra than this.</p>
