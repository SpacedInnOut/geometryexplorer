<h1>Dragon Ball Z</h1>

<p>A compelling story must be grounded and have a reasonable sense of scale (this is what we call the story "fitting together"), characters I care about, pacing, and consequences. This anime achieves none of them, because the only reason you want a fight to be over in this show is because you can't stand the incessant screaming. (Why I didn't drop this earlier is a mystery to me as well.)</p>

<p>The story of Dragon Ball is a lazy rip of Journey to the West, but at least it's better than this, which seems to be literally nothing. Screaming is not story, "I kill people/protect Earth because I can" is not story, "Super Saiyan N" for ridiculously large N is not story, training arcs where the characters don't come away with a change in mentality are not story, and Dragon Ball Z is not story.</p>

<p>I don't need to explain the sexist tropes at play here, how annoying some of the characters are, how idiotic the power scaling is, how excessive the stretching of each episode is, and how mindless the fights are - anyone who has watched this show, and hell, even people who have only heard of it know about this - I'm going to focus on the biggest flaw; lack of consequences.</p>

<p>There's no consequences for anything. And therein lies the issue; you cannot convince me that someone is noble, valiant, selfish, evil, or much of anything if their actions are just devoid of meaning. Avengers was not the pioneer of death being irrelevant, and I apologize to the saga for condemning it for being the most inconsequential work to ever hit TV, because DBZ has taken the cake from it. If you want to convince me that your characters are making tough decisions, or that there's nuance to their actions, there needs to be a reason that I care about the resolution of the conflict. "Goku was supposed to be selfish," you say? Goku's not selfish, in need of redemption, or someone who does some evil things, because he and his actions don't matter. And "it's about the journey not the destination" would be a much fairer point if the journey wasn't boring training arc after boring training arc. With a lack of consequences there is a lack of change; this would be fine if demonstrating how static characters get affected by a dynamic world was the point, but the world also doesn't punish the characters or force them to adapt.</p>

<p>I'm not one to care about art or sound usually, but oh goodness is Goku ugly. And oh goodness is the voice acting obnoxious. (Nothing against the voice actors, I'd find anyone who screamed for hours on end annoying.) My brain would be imploding if my ears weren't keeping it occupied by bleeding out.</p>
