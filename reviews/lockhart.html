<h1>Lockhart's Lament</h1>

<p>Lockhart starts out with a compelling metaphor and an unequivocal condemnation of the flaws of math classes, and I have no qualms with Lockhart's attack on most high school math teachers; I am sure they are nice people, but 90% of any art form is bad. It follows that a high proportion of artists are bad too, and "doing my best" is not a valid reason to allow boring teachers who know nothing about math to pass down awful and wrong pedagogical lessons to children. The current state of mathematics education has reached an absurd level of idiocy, and Lockhart attacks systems such as the inane two-column proof with remarkable accuracy and prescience.</p>

<p>However, his proposed solutions are absurd at best, and his extreme views are neither practical nor reflective of what an ideal class looks like. Finding and clearly identifying a problem is enough to create value in an essay; there is no need to add half-baked solutions in the mix, or extreme views that do not hold any water. He falls to the same trap that the cronies of Common Core and other similarly immoral "education reform movements" do; in being so utterly convinced of his convictions, he starts making up suggestions as an afterthought, treating the classroom as if it ought to be opposite day and categorically rejecting every practice that math teachers currently follow. The reality is clearly more nuanced, and refusing to consider an idea because of ideology is how American education landed in this awful mess to begin with.</p>
