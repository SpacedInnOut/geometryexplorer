<h1>Demon Slayer</h1>

<p>I spoil pretty much every show under the sun (Death Note, My Hero Academia, this show) to make a point on how much potential this show had, and how it threw it away.</p>

<p>This anime is just mediocre. On one hand, the action is just beautiful and the demons are just splendid. But the story is non-existent and some characters are straight up annoying. I think that if you're doing some work and want to turn your brain off while watching a series, then this is probably a good pick for you, which is why the anime is fine. Save the good anime for when you have more attention to devote to them.</p>

<p>The wonderfully choreographed action and fight scenes did an amazing job at showing off the animation of the story, but at some point that becomes insufficient as we have meaningless fight after meaningless fight. This series suffers from what I call "My Hero Academia syndrome," where meaningless and often boring fights happen just to show off the animation. From a story-telling perspective, these sorts of violent conflicts fall into two categories: the fight scene and the action scene. The fight scene is meant to exhibit the internal and emotional conflicts of characters and manifest them into a more tangible form that pushes the plot forward, much like the fight between Bakugo and Deku outside the dormitory. And the action scene is meant to highlight the resourcefulness of the characters, to impress and dazzle us not only with the scenery, but also the machinations of the character's minds, and the consideration that the writers took when developing such an elaborate scene. Matsuda's escape from the Yotsuba Group's headquarters was a thrilling example of this, because while his escape was not wholly unexpected, the crazy steps that the rest of the investigative team had to take for this to happen left me on the edge of my seat. And obviously some (and most) scenes can do a mixture of both, giving us a clearer view of how the characters think and feel, while also showing how calculating the characters (and the writer!) can be. Unfortunately, no violent conflict in this anime does either task well; no emotion in any fight scene was nuanced, novel, or powerful enough to warrant a fight scene, and the "resourcefulness" demonstrated really is about as impressive as discreetly Googling the answer to a hard question your friend asked you.</p>

<p>It's okay for a character to have an unpleasant personality in a nuanced manner if they want to use said character's development (or lack thereof) to make a point in the story. But some characters are just annoying for the sake of being annoying, possibly to make us feel better about them after their inexplicable bouts of usefulness. The gag characters are so bad that it almost feels like this entire series is supposed to be a joke. If this series is for entertainment value, rather than something more profound or revealing, that's fine; just don't make me feel weirded out by the sudden jumps from a serious mood to a jokey mood, and most importantly, don't piss me off with idiotic characters. Nothing's so unbearable to the point where it gets rated along with shows like No Game No Life or The Seven Deadly Sins, where the annoying and often problematic undertones precede the charm that either of them may have had. At the very least, the good points of the show pop up before the bad, and it's still watchable.</p>

<p>Speaking of character development (what character development), the static nature of the show is repetitive and pointless. It's almost like you could cut out every episode sans the first few and the last few, and not significantly change the plot in any way. One of the worst parts - second only to the unbearable training arc at the beginning of this show - is that death is treated like a joke, and people dying is just moved on from. For what I presume is a show for a primarily younger audience, the complete disregard for which this show treats death is frankly jarring. When the pig character - who is also annoying for absolutely no reason - disregards the dead, our Mary Sue decides to goad him into burying the dead. It strikes me as extremely inconsiderate, and missing the point entirely; a disrespect for life from a character should be treated with seriousness, and should not be shot back at with a gag.</p>

<p>The idea that behind every demon was a human, a person who had their own dreams and ambitions (which frequently took a melodramatic turn) was one ripe for nuance and psychological terror. Instead we get the demons crying and our Mary Sue of a protagonist feeling sad for them for about 5 seconds before they die, and then the demons just stop mattering. Even with a somewhat generic premise, a horrifying atmosphere or a tragedy could've been executed wonderfully. The psychological terror that demons face as they know they have to kill humans to survive and/or as their minds deteriorate, the pain it causes the Demon Slayers to kill demons who were once humans and still have and remember their failed dreams and aspirations, and are capable of feeling regret, satisfaction, and closure, and the internal conflict the main character faces as he is pulled between his duty as a Demon Slayer and his duty as a brother would have been much more compelling shows to watch than what we have now. A show aimed at children should not aim to dumb itself down; dumb children, we know, become dumb adults. Instead a show should evoke a child's curiosity and shake the simplistic moral beliefs they hold (lest they continue with similarly simplistic beliefs into their adulthood). There is no sense of wonder in this show, so the argument that it's a "kid's show" is completely uncompelling.</p>

<p>It's a shame that this show tried to become a generic "villain of the week" show for mass appeal, because it could have been so much more. Ironically, its complete lack of plot and nuance makes the story interesting for almost nobody.</p>
