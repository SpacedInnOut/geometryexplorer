<h1>Fish in a Tree</h1>
<p>Fish in a Tree is a book that did not need to happen. This book reads like Wonder, except completely unrealistic and unnecessary, and every character is defined by a gimmick, like "I'm dyslexic," "I'm poor," or "I am a really mean bully and it's supposed to be cathartic when I 'get my comeuppance' or something." For a book that's supposed to tackle a very difficult and nuanced subject, there's no nuance or subtlety to be found. The plot reads like a poorly written fanfiction written by a teenager who's a little bit too into revenge stories.</p>

<p>People don't talk like this! Every character feels like they're talking to get some boxes ticked. Conflict between friends in the middle to the end of the book that happens because "nobody understands me?" Check. Everyone telling the bully how worthless she is and turning the tables on her out of the blue? Check. White knight teacher saving the student because "I'm the only one who understands you?" Check. And this last plot point is so awful I can't stomach it. "Just wait for a miracle to happen" is seriously the worst message you can tell someone who's down.</p>

<p>While good dialogue has to serve a purpose, it has to do so naturally. And while a good plot has to have actions or events that contribute to the plot, they have to do so naturally.</p>

<p>This book is unable to function as a critique on contemporary society because it is so <i>unaware</i> of contemporary society. We live a world that suffers from the ideological titans formed by ignoring the consequences of their philosophies just because they sound nice and is all too willing to deny people a second chance without acknowledging that a large number of their "unacceptable behaviors" are largely a product of their environment, and Hunt ignores all of this when writing her "societal critique" that serves only to reinforce the status quo.</p>

<p>The lack of verisimilitude in this story and its school environment shows how out of touch Hunt is with the environment she writes about. Kids can be meticulous planners and remarkably effective at exclusion, but kids are not monsters for some imaginary ideological reason that adults are far too often willing to prescribe despite no evidence; kids are monsters of ignorance, unable to correctly weigh the fleeting entertainment they are currently getting against the long-term damage that they do to those they exclude, those they belittle, and those they victimize. I suspect the reason many adults are unable to realize this is because in more subtle ways, they are still unable to weigh options or consequences against each other; there is a reason that so many of them are stuck working menial and uninteresting office jobs in their uninteresting lives, going along the path that society has planned for them.</p>

<p>At the end of the story nobody learns that their actions have consequences; obviously, Shay does not learn this because she was <i>written</i> to be the character that the audience hates at the expense of nuance, but more subtly, Ally and her friends do not learn the value of considering the consequences of her actions or weighing their options against each other. And this is not to say that Ally and her cohort always made the wrong decision or that they aren't good people, but it is unconvincing when Hunt preaches the righteousness of her protagonists when she fails to consider the consequences of any of their actions and fails to consider the other options they had at their disposal.</p>
