<h1>Yugami-kun Has No Friends</h1>

<p>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of those anime that get a massive amount of hype, and let me be clear: it's not entirely unjustified. This is definitely a show worth watching, but I do not feel that this is the best anime to ever exist. So I will only cover the negatives.</p>

<p>For an anime about cost and consequences, few of the major events have a human motivation - it is always the Homunculus doing this or that, and this feels more like an epic, with grand actions and world-changing consequences, rather than a personal tale of mistakes, tragedy, and redemption. I also found most of what Edward and Al did that wasn't a fight scene to be kind of boring, but the fights and some of the more interesting characters like Mustang did make up for this. This anime definitely suffers a little bit from shonen-itis, with its characters reaffirming motivations that we already knew they held from episode 1, instead of changing their perspective based on the results of their actions. There was also some really silly spat between the brothers early on about how Al could've just been a fake which was just stupid.</p>

<p>Overall the characters lack any form of psychology. Edward hates being short, milk, wants to get his brother's body back, etc, but these are just basic facts about him that we learned in the first few episodes. The show sorely needed an exploration of Edward's ideals and how his failed attempt at human transmutation would change him, and it definitely needed more moral conflict than "government = bad" because that has never been a new concept. The soldiers from the government that defected to help Ed's cause also had surprisingly shallow motivations, and them learning that Kimblee or whoever do not actually care about them should not be surprising. Instead, it would have been preferable to see the struggle of a powerful and capable individual working for the wrong people as he struggles between doing what's right and the sense of loyalty that was instilled in him. And FMAB seems to know this, too; you can see that there are signs of mature writing here, but they never really got developed.</p>

<p>This is another one of those shows where you can turn your brain off, but if you turn your brain off it is genuinely enjoyable, and it doesn't force you to turn your brain off with excessive amounts of cringe. (Alright, there is some cringe, but it is much less pronounced than other shows which I dropped because of the cringe, like NGNL, Demon Slayer, or Seven Deadly Sins).</p>

<p>The ending is a complete waste of time; it's completely unwatchable and makes me want to tear my hair out. If you're one of those people who cannot stand a series without an ending (or a good ending), you should avoid this like the plague because you will want something to happen, and you will want it bad.</p>
