<h1>I, Robot</h1>
<p>Isaac Asimov's collection of robot short stories, if described on a surface level, is not the type of book that most outside of a select few sci-fi enthusiasts would be interested in reading. The argument that no action happens in any story can be made easily and with great veracity; indeed, most of the stories can be likened to thought experiments, where the conflict is formed by a given scenario that the characters are put in and the resolution formed by their solution.</p>

<p>But this is a facetious argument and misses the point of the book. The stories are so appealing because of the simplicity of the scenarios and resolutions. Asimov has enough confidence in his stories not to bluff by introducing complex worlds devoid of substance; he takes his simple premises, explores them, and in doing so, uses his stories touch on a very human aspect of our lives. By using themes from companionship and abandonment in the simple yet heartwarming tale of Gloria to the reverse psychology that the machines in The Evitable Conflict apply to the manipulatable Society, Asimov is able to make us cringe when the grumpy Pollock berates his friend, feel pity for the spoiled Gloria when her robotic friend Robbie is nowhere to be seen, and awed at the magnificence of the simple yet effective planning of Byerly. Though the stories are disjoint, they all feel like part of the same world; instead of feeling like a compilation of disconnected stories, I, Robot instead reads like an epic saga outlining the rise of positronic robots.</p>
