<h1>Reviews</h1>
  <p>My reviews for various media, such as books, anime, and manga.</p>

  <h2>Books</h2>
  
  <h3>Non-fiction</h3>
  
  <p><a href="/reviews/nixon">All the President's Men</a></p>
  <!--to-do: <p>Den of Thieves</p>-->
  <p><a href="/reviews/duane">You Have the Right to Remain Innocent</a></p>

  <p>Books are ordered in no particular order, because history tends to nearly always be interesting.</p>

  <h3>Fiction</h3>
  
  <p>Assume every review here contains spoilers unless told explicitly otherwise. (I almost always talk about the book when reviewing it, because otherwise what am I even talking <i>about</i>?)</p>
  
  <p>Books nearer to the top have higher ratings than the ones near the bottom, though I suspect over time I will get lax about this or forget about it entirely.</p>
  
  <p><a href="/reviews/robot">I, Robot</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/jekyll">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/metamorphosis">The Metamorphosis</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/supernova">Supernova</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/legend">Legend</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/fish">Fish in a Tree</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/abc">American Born Chinese</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/patient">The Silent Patient</a></p>
  
  <h3>Textbooks</h3>
  <p>You don't even need to click on the links to know which reviews are good and which ones are bad (spoiler: none of them are good). AoPS Introduction to Geometry is first because I think it's the most controversial/impactful review out of these.</p>

  <p><a href="/essay/aopsgeo">AoPS Introduction to Geometry</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/lockhart">Lockhart's Lament</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/norman">Linear Algebra (Norman)</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/cpm">Calculus (CPM)</a></p>
  <p><a href="/reviews/amsco">AP World (AMSCO)</a></p>

<h2>Anime and Manga</h2>

<p>This page is ordered by how much I liked each of the series.</p>

<p><a href="/reviews/yugami">Yugami-kun</a></p>

<p><a href="/reviews/fmab">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></p>

<p><a href="/reviews/demonslayer">Demon Slayer</a> (Warning: Spoilers for Death Note, My Hero Academia, and obviously, Demon Slayer.)</p>

<p><a href="/reviews/whisker">A Whisker Away</a></p>

<p><a href="/reviews/dbz">Dragon Ball Z</a></p>

<p><a href="/reviews/neverland">Promised Neverland</a></p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>The reason this page exists is secondarily because I want to put more content on my website and because not seeing the ratings of a book are going to make my thoughts on it more impartial, and primarily because I can't trust aggregate review sites not to delete my stuff. This was specifically prompted by the removal of a <a href="/reviews/neverland">sarcastic review</a> from MyAnimeList for "not following content guidelines." Luckily I was extended the courtesy of having my review actually sent to me and having an explanation provided (even if I disagreed with the provided explanation), so I was able to put it on my site.</p>
<p>I've heard similar horror stories from Goodreads, where many controversial reviews were taken down, and in this case the content of the reviews were not preserved. While I'm sure that the people at aggregate review sites like MyAnimeList and Goodreads are wonderful people and I appreciate the services that they provide, such centralized authorities and their regulations would only serve to inhibit my content, even though their policies may make their site overall a better place. Therefore I have decided that my content will exist on my own page.</p>
