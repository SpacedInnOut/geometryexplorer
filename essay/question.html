<h1>Usefully Asked Questions</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated June 10, 2020.</em></p>
<p>These are some useful questions that people have asked me. Some of these have been asked very frequently, and others are questions that I believe people would benefit from knowing the answer to (even if they don't ask the question themselves).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>What's your background? Who are you?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm Dennis Chen, rising sophomore, math enthusiast, and track runner. Two-time AIME qualifier and USAJMO qualifier.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>I liked the preview for your geometry book. Where can I get the full version?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowhere, since as of right now it is not finished yet. If you take my classes you will be able to see more snippets of it.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can you give me solutions to your mock AIME?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, just PM me on AoPS or email me. Unless if you want a solution to #15, in which case, see below.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can you give me a solution to #15 on your mock AIME?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, I seem to have misplaced the solution and forgot how to do the problem. I can tell you that the numerical answer is 19/30, but that's all that's in my notes.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>You've been talking about opening an AMC program during the summer. Details?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll announce them as soon as I've got something concrete to work with! Right now it's just an idea in my head. I'll try to pester the local STEM organization into hosting, but no guarantees everything works out.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can I apply for MAST if I didn't make AIME/scored badly/etc?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure. I'll accept you if you demonstrate through the Diagnostic that you've gotten better between the competition and now and that you're ready for the program.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>How did you make this website?</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote the HTML/CSS on this website myself. I learned some basic HTML/CSS on my own, using tutorials when necessary. I host on Github. The domain provider you use doesn't matter, but for the record, I'm using Namecheap. See <a href="https://github.com/chennisden/geometryexplorer">here</a> for my Github repository.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>If you could go back and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't be afraid to surpass the people you admire.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can I talk to you/hangout/ask you a question?</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to slide into the DMs. I promise it won't kill you - after all, plenty of people have survived.</p>
