<h1 style="text-align: center;">Tutoring</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">I am Dennis Chen, a freshman (as of the 2019-2020 school year) who likes to do math and run track. In my spare time I will tutor some schoolkids for low(ish) rates.&nbsp;<strong>This is for school math, not contest math: See <a href="https://mast.geometryexplorer.xyz/">MAST</a> if you are trying to find my competition math program.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Qualifications</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">I do math competitions and have been teaching competition math for 3 years now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2020 - USAJMO Qualifier. AMC 10 DHR, 11 on AIME. Cowconuts winner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2019 - Geometry Bee winner. State MATHCOUNTS qualifier. AIME qualifier.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2018 - School MATCHOUNTS winner, State qualifier.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are these contests?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Cowconuts, Geometry Bee, and School MATHCOUNTS are Local competitions in the Trivalley area. The 2nd and 3rd competitions were for middle schoolers in the PUSD. "Winner" refers to first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">State MATHCOUNTS is a state-wide math competition (for each state) for middle schoolers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The AIME is an invitational exam that (approximately) 5000 high school students from around the nation qualify for through the AMC.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The USAJMO is an invitational olympiad that (approximately) 250 high school students grade 10 or under from the nation qualify for through the AMC and AIME.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teaching:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I haven't really been teaching school math that often and I mainly focus on competition math. A select subset of my material is available <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/">here</a>, and my competition math program for AIME qualifiers is <a href="https://mast.geometryexplorer.xyz/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Fun Facts</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">Favorite subject (not math): History</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Favorite fruits: Strawberries and blackberries (in this order!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Games: Starcraft 2, CS:GO, <small>(and yes)</small> Minecraft.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Materials</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">I will probably create a specific google drive folder for you with your materials and stuff.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who will I tutor?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Short answer: Anyone in the Trivalley area (CA) who is taking Pre-calculus or a lower class.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Long answer: I would prefer not to have people driving long drives to meet me for a short duration of time. I'm not particularly special when it comes to math tutoring for schoolkids - I just have a somewhat defined philosophy for math and some contest awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I do think, however, you will have a significantly higher probability of benefiting if you are in an honors math class.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I also do not trust myself to teach calculus "properly" (see <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/">MIT Opencourseware</a> for a good calculus book).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Oddities</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">There are a couple of strange things about my teaching style compared to "normal" tutors, so I should get them out there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Not philosophy in the "very old Greek dudes" sense, but philosophy in the "there are some things that cannot be explicitly defined but will make you better at math." <a title="From Evan Chen's &quot;Math contest platitudes.&quot;" href="https://usamo.wordpress.com/2019/01/31/math-contest-platitudes-v3/">Despite being what might appear to be a cold and logical discipline, learning math and getting better at it actually requires being&nbsp;<em>human</em>.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Contest math:</strong> Sorry, but I really cannot resist giving people some contest math questions (and teaching in a similar fashion to contest math). I think that most people really suck at learning/teaching math because they've never taken a "deep dive" into it. I promise that this will be helpful to you. There are two types of problems I will give you:&nbsp;<em>Check-in</em> problems and&nbsp;<em>contest</em> problems (or&nbsp;<em>problem&nbsp;</em>problems). Your book only gives you the first type. If you don't solve&nbsp;<em>problem&nbsp;</em>problems, how are you actually supposed to learn anything?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Effort:</strong> You should probably put a good amount of it in. But in all honesty, I don't actually expect that I will need to put a ton in. Here's the reason:&nbsp;Check-in problems are either so boring/non-unique that I can make them up off the top of my head or are classic problems that I remember, and I have a repository of contest problems. (This is why I don't think getting tutored by me will be anything&nbsp;<em>special</em>, because at some point people just <em>know the material</em> well enough that they don't need any outside references to teach it.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Blame your textbook:</strong> A lot of people think it's their fault they can't learn math well in school. It's actually not the vast majority of the time. In fact, the only real "mistake" is being ignorant that better materials exist. (This is usually contest math stuff.) It doesn't matter what your school textbook is:&nbsp;<strong>it sucks and is probably holding you back significantly</strong>. So find&nbsp;<em>anything else</em>. (Feel free to get in touch with me for suggestions.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Payment</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Due to the COVID-19 crisis,&nbsp;<strong>classes will be free</strong>.</p>
