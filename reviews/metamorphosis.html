<h1>The Metamorphosis</h1>
<em>This story is not a light read; this is less of a traditional review on "did I like it or not" (I did) and more "what the hell just happened?"</em>

<p>This novella is a masterful allegory of the treatment of the chronically ill. The text is littered with implications that Gregor’s transformation symbolizes the onset of a chronic disease that leaves him unable to work. From Gregor’s initial denial of his condition to how his once-caring sister ultimately wishes for Gregor to die, Kafka’s work is an unequivocal condemnation of the way our society treats the sickly.</p>

<p>Gregor's denial and the eventual sinking in of the realization of his condition mirrors the horror the sick face when they gradually lose what makes them human. Initially, he tricks himself into believing that his work is his utmost priority, but external pressure from his sister begging him to is all that is needed to crumble his facade; his sister’s insistence that Gregor play his designated role only serves to emphasize his inability to do so.</p>

<p>
The family’s refusal to look at Gregor also has striking parallels to a family’s refusal to dwell on the sickly condition of their loved one. Kafka’s implication is that the Samsa family cannot bear to see Gregor in this state and lack the ability to help, and perhaps more sinister, that Gregor’s lack of use has caused the mental space the family devotes to him to shrink. His family clings to an idealized notion of Gregor based on his role as the provider of the family; any contradictions to this fantasy, notably including Gregor himself, provoke distress in the case of his mother and rage in the case of his father.</p>

<p>The strongest and most poignant point in favor of this allegory, however, must be Grete’s plea for Gregor to die. She despairs because Gregor cannot serve the role he used to fill, she despairs because Gregor is in such a pitiful state, and most of all, she despairs because she feels that she and her family can do nothing to help Gregor. She laments that “we have tried what is humanly possible to take care of it and to be patient,” and her frustration that their care is ultimately only warding off the inevitable and that things cannot go back to normal is apparent. Because what she cherishes are the ‘good old days’ and there is nothing to cling onto, she clings onto an idealized notion of the Gregor Samsa of the past, and choosing to neglect and ultimately reject the Gregor of the present.</p>

<p>Under these lenses, the ending then is explained. Gregor dies abruptly and Gregor's family faces no few consequences because Kafka is normalizing the Samsa family's behavior after the surreal and irrational behavior of the Samsa family before. When characters react nonchalantly to something we would deem horrifying, the story is making a point; our moral fashion, just as much as the Samsas', was stitched together by a matter of chance, with our own horrifying, bizarre, and immoral conventions. Samsa's surreal work is not meant to be vaguely intriguing and horrifying; it is meant to be a reflection on how there are surreal aspects of our own lives that we take for granted and are worth a second look. Indeed, this is part of the value of literature in general; our own lives are beautiful, mysterious, and horrifying, and only when looking from the perspective of an outsider do we gain some of the objectivity and perspective needed to make these realizations.</p>

<p>The execution is masterful; the allegory holds water only because Franz Kafka was so intimately familiar with the fear and denial that the Samsa family, including Gregor, felt. This book is one of my favorite examples of static characters done in a deliberate manner; the inability of the Samsa family to take away anything from Gregor's death is meant to highlight the contrast between a cast of static characters and the dynamic world they live in. And Kafka does that wonderfully; instead of making moral judgements on his characters or proselytizing his own views, he leaves the reader horrified at Gregor's treatment, then indignant at the fact that our society acts the same way, and finally chilling us with the realization that those who have outlived their usefulness, such as the chronically ill, are left to be discarded and that there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
