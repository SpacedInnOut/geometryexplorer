<h1>Where to Start?</h1>
<p><em>Last updated May 1, 2020.</em></p>
<p>Here's my list of recommended materials for math competitions, along with some thoughts and advice on how to prepare for the AMCs and AIME. Especially for beginning students, <b>I must stress the following:</b> Don't let your past self get in the way of your future self, and don't be a completionist. [1][2]</p>

<h2>Introductory</h2>

<h2>AIME</h2>

<h2>Classics</h2>
<p>These are resources that I haven't really used that thoroughly. But they're almost universally mentioned by other people in response to "where to start" threads, so I figure it does more good than harm to have them here.</p>
<p><b>AoPS Introductory Textbooks</b> - </p>
<p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8JbOaFM5Xo_bnc2NUd0dDFLY1U/view">AIME Handout</a></b> - Very brief exposition of topics followed by a plethora of AIME problems. [3]</p>
<p><b><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/aops-cdn.artofproblemsolving.com/resources/articles/olympiad-number-theory.pdf">Justin Stevens</a></b> - A gentle introduction to Olympiad NT. [4] Requires no previous knowledge.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/articles/files/SatoNT.pdf">Naoki Sato</a></b> - </p>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>
<p>References to other people's websites that I've found useful or enlightening. In practice, you'll probably be fine if you just look through here to start and completely ignore my website.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/"></a>web.evanchen.cc/</b> - IMO gold medalist (2014) and current olympiad coach. Materials are on the hard side. His <a href="https://usamo.wordpress.com/">posts</a> about math pedagogy are enlightening. [5]</p>
<p><b><a href="paulgraham.com/articles.html">paulgraham.com/articles.html</a></b> - Essays from computer scientist Paul Graham. While his content isn't directly related to maht competitions, his ides about work are incredibly helpful.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://davidaltizio.web.illinois.edu/">https://davidaltizio.web.illinois.edu/</a></b></p>
<p><b><a href="https://numbertheoryguy.com/">https://numbertheoryguy.com/</a></b></p>

<h2>Liftoff</h2>
<p>This is roughly what I believe people who're completely new to math competitions should start with. I highly recommend reading <a href = "essay/diminish">Diminishing Returns</a> for one of the most common mistakes and how to avoid it, and <a href = "https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/escape">Escape Velocity</a> so you understand why learning math is so hard, and how to combat some ingrained bad habits. Important disclaimer: <b>I am only one person.</b> Learning is really just the integration and synthesis of different useful perspectives. [6] So listen to what other contestants say too.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>[1] This is the short version of my essay <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/diminish">Diminishing Returns</a>.</p>
<p>[2] The effects of making these two mistakes is the same. But the way to tell people about them is slightly different. This slight difference may actually have significant effects.</p>
<p>[3] I haven't extensively used it, but as far as I can tell this resource is pretty conservative with what it teaches. My main criticism is that it almost feels <i>sheltered</i>.</p>
<p>[4] This does not come at the expense at thoroughness.</p>
<p>[5] I might go as far to say that would be the most useful part of his website for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>[6] The qualifier "useful" is very important. When your math teacher tells you that you need to <i>explain</i> so-and-so to your classmates instead of just being certain you're right, they're insisting you synthesize <i>useless</i> perspectives.</p>
